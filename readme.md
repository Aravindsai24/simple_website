# Controllers
## LoginController
It handles the login page (route `/login`)
it takes the username and password from the user checks in the `users` database for validation, on matching credentials it navigates the user to postLogin screen (i.e., URL input screen) and wrong credentials it redirects the user to the same login page again.

## RegistrationController
It handles the register page (route `/register`)
it takes the username and password of the new user and adds the details to `users` table in tha database.

## PostLoginController
It takes the url from the user and maps the url with userID and pushes it to the `userData` table. Directs user to the third screen showing the entered url.

# Models

 * UserData model is to store the user specified url along with the userID.

# Repository

 * UserDataRepository provides the abstraction to access the data in `userData` table
